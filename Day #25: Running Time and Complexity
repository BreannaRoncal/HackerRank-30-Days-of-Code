"""
A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a 
number, n, determine and print whether it is Prime or Not prime.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, N, the number of test cases.
Each of the N subsequent lines contains an integer, num, to be tested for primality.

Example Input:
  3
  12
  5
  7
  
Example Output:
  Not prime
  Prime
  Prime
