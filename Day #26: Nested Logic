"""
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). 
The fee structure is as follows:

    1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
    2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date,
       the fine = 15 x (number of days late).
    3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, 
       the fine = 500 x (number of months late).
    4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000.
    
Input Format:
  The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was actually returned.
  The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).
  
Example Input:
  9 6 2015
  6 6 2015
  
Example Output:
  45
