"""
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is 
the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you 
in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:
   -A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
        1. A string, firstName.
        2. A string, lastName.
        3. An integer, id.
        4. An integer array (or vector) of test scores,scores.

    -A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and 
     returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
     0: 90 <= average <= 100
     E: 80 <= average < 90
     A: 70 <= average < 80
     P: 55 <= average < 70
     D: 40 <= average < 55
     T: average < 40

Example Input:
  Heraldo Memelli 8135627
  2
  100 80
  
Example Output:
  Name: Memelli, Heraldo
  ID: 8135627
  Grade: O
