"""
The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a - b|. The maximum absolute difference
between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between 
any two integers in elements.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (alements) for 
storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
  -A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements
  instance variable.
  -A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2
   numbers in N and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
   
Example Input:
  3
  1 2 5
  
Example Output:
  4
