/**
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.
