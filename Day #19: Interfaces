"""
The AdvancedArithmetic interface and the method declaration for the abstract divisorSum(n) method are 
provided for you in the editor below.

Complete the implementation of Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface. 
The implementation for the divisorSum(n) method must return the sum of all divisors of n.

Example Input:
  6
  
Example Output:
  I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
  12
  
Explanation:
  6 is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, which totals to 12.
